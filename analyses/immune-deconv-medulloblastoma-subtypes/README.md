### Description

Analysis which investigates whether there are differences in the immune cell distribution in tumors with different medulloblastoma subtypes (WNT, SHH, Group3, andGroup4). Generate a PCA plot.

### Running the analysis

The following script will run the full analysis using `analyses/immune-deconv/results/quantiseq_output.rds` file from immune-deconv analysis.

```
bash run-immune-deconv-medulloblastoma-subtypes.sh
```
